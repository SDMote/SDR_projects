Guided tutorial on QPSK modulation and demodulation through simulated channel: https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php?title=QPSK_Mod_and_Demod
Not very useful, other than the introduction of Channel Model block, see QPSK_differential for a better explanation using actual over-the-air transmission with a Pluto SDR
