# BLE & IEEE 802.15.4 Demodulation with Python

This folder contains Python scripts for demodulating BLE packets from IQ baseband measurements. Support for IEEE 802.15.4 demodulation will be added soon.

## TODO
- IEEE 802.15.4 demodulation
- Controlled subtraction of interference
- Intermediate frequency (not baseband) demodulation
